// In earlier chapters, you developed a Fraction structure for Teacher’s Pet Software. The
// structure contains three public data fields for whole number, numerator, and denominator.
// Using the same structure, write a main()function in which you create three Fraction
// objects. Prompt the user for values for each field for two of the Fractions. Add statements
// to the main()function to do the following:
// » Do not allow the user to enter a 0 denominator for any Fraction; continue to prompt
// the user until an acceptable denominator is entered.
// » Reduce each Fraction to proper fraction form and display it. For example, the following
// table shows some user entries and the output you should display.
// //

// » Prompt the user to enter an arithmetic operation: + or *. Calculate the third Fraction to
// be the result of applying the requested operation to the two entered Fractions. Display
// the result as a whole number, if any, and the fractional part, if any. Reduce the result to
// proper form. For example, adding 1/4 and 1/4 results in 1/2, adding 3/4 and 3/4 results in
// 1 1/2, subtracting 1/5 from 3/1 results in 2 4/5, and multiplying 1/3 by 6/1 results in 2.
